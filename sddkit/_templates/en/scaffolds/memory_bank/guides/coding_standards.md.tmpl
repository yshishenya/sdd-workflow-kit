# Coding Standards (Seeded)

This is a starting point. Customize it for your stack and enforce it with tooling.

---

## General

- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- Prefer readable code over clever code.
- Avoid “drive-by” formatting across unrelated files.
- Add tests for behaviour changes and bug fixes.

## Style and formatting

- Use the repo formatter/linter as the source of truth.
- Prefer auto-formatters over manual alignment.
- Keep imports organized (tool-driven when available).

## Naming and structure

- Use consistent naming across modules.
- Keep public APIs small and well documented.
- Keep domain logic separate from IO (DB/network/UI) where practical.

## Error handling

- Follow `../patterns/error_handling.md`.
- Never log secrets.
- Prefer actionable error messages and explicit error codes.

## Testing

- Keep tests deterministic.
- Cover happy path + at least one negative/edge case for critical code.
- Prefer integration tests for cross-module behaviour; add unit tests for logic-heavy functions.
