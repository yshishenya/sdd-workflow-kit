# Task Updates (Conflict-Free Rules)

Goal: track work without creating merge conflicts.

---

## Rules

1. On feature branches, **do not edit** `../current_tasks.md`.
2. On feature branches, write updates into `../branch_updates/*.md` instead.
3. On the integration branch, periodically:
   - merge branch updates into `../current_tasks.md`
   - delete processed `branch_updates/*.md`

---

## What to write in `branch_updates/*.md`

- What changed
- Decisions made
- Validation commands run (and results)
- Next steps / blockers

Use:

- `../branch_updates/_template.md`
