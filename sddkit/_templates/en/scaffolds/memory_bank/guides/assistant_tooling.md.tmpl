# Assistant Tooling (Seeded)

This repo can be used with AI agents (Codex, Claude, etc.). This guide documents the expected interaction style and where tool configuration lives.

---

## Where tool configuration lives

- `AGENTS.md`: the primary agent context (high-level rules, commands, repo map)
- `docs/SDD/README.md`: workflow details (if this kit scaffolds it)
- `meta/memory_bank/`: deeper context and conventions (this directory)

If this repo uses Spec Kit (recommended for new work), feature artifacts live in:

- `specs/###-feature-name/spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`

---

## How to run commands

Agents can run commands via the terminal. Prefer running real commands over guessing.

Typical workflow:

1. Read the relevant docs (`AGENTS.md`, Memory Bank, spec/plan/tasks)
2. Propose a minimal plan
3. Execute commands (format/lint/test) and report results

---

## “Script-first” rule (when scripts exist)

If the workflow provides scripts (for example under `.specify/scripts/`), always:

1. Run the script first
2. Use the script output (often JSON) as the source of truth
3. Only inspect script source code if execution fails and debugging is needed
