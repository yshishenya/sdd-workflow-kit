# Testing Strategy (Seeded)

Goal: confidence without slowing the team down.

Prefer tests that are:

- deterministic
- fast enough for everyday use
- representative of real behaviour

---

## Recommended layers

- Unit tests: pure logic, no network/DB
- Integration tests: DB/network boundaries, API handlers, background jobs
- E2E tests: critical user journeys (only a few, stable)

---

## How to run tests

Keep these commands updated:

- Unit/integration: `{{test_cmd}}`
- Lint: `{{lint_cmd}}`
- Format: `{{format_cmd}}`

If this repo uses Docker-first workflows, document the docker-based commands here.

---

## PR expectations

- Bug fix PRs must include a regression test (or a clear reason why it’s not practical).
- New features should include tests for critical paths and at least one negative case.
