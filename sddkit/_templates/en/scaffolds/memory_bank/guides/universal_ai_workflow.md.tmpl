# Universal AI Workflow (Seeded)

This workflow is project-agnostic guidance for AI-assisted development.

---

## Before changing code

1. Read `AGENTS.md`
2. Read relevant docs (Memory Bank / `docs/` / spec/plan/tasks)
3. Identify the smallest change that solves the problem
4. Confirm verification steps (real commands)

## While implementing

- Keep diffs small and focused
- Prefer safe defaults and explicit behaviour
- Add tests where it matters
- Avoid speculative refactors

## Before opening a PR

- Run tests/lint/format
- Summarize risk and rollback
- Link the spec/work item
