# Commit Messages (Detailed Policy)

This project requires detailed commit messages so changes are easy to understand and review.

## Required format

Title (<= 72 chars, Conventional Commits):

```
<type>: <short summary>
```

Blank line, then required sections:

```
Context:
- why this change was needed

Changes:
- key changes (files/modules)

Tests:
- not run (reason) OR list tests

Risks:
- none OR describe risks/migrations
```

## Enforcement (automatic)

We enforce this with a git hook + commit template:

- Hook: `.githooks/commit-msg`
- Template: `.gitmessage`

Run once per clone to enable:

```bash
meta/tools/setup_git_hooks.sh
```

## Notes

- Merge/revert/fixup/squash commits are exempted by the hook.
- If tests are not run, always state the reason in `Tests:`.
