# Commit Messages (Seeded)

Use Conventional Commits:

`type(scope): summary`

Examples:

- `feat(api): add export endpoint`
- `fix(auth): handle token refresh race`
- `chore(ci): pin action versions`

Guidelines:

- Keep commits small and atomic.
- Use imperative mood in the subject (“add”, “fix”, “refactor”).
- Use the body to explain **why** (not just what).
