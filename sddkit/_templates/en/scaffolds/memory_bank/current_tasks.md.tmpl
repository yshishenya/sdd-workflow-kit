# Current Tasks (Integration Branch Only)

This is the shared, merge-conflict-prone task list. To keep merges clean:

- Do **not** edit this file on feature branches.
- Use `./branch_updates/*.md` on feature branches.
- On the integration branch, consolidate updates into this file and delete processed `branch_updates/*`.

Detailed rules:

- `./guides/task_updates.md`
