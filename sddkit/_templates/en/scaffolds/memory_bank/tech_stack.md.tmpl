# Tech Stack (Seeded)

This file is the canonical place to record **what this repo runs on** and **what versions are required**.

Update it whenever you:

- add/remove a dependency
- change runtime requirements
- change build/test/lint/format commands
- introduce a new external service (DB, queue, cache, LLM provider, etc.)

---

## Runtimes

- Language/runtime(s): `<fill>`
- Minimum versions: `<fill>`
- Package manager(s): `<fill>`

Examples (replace with your real values):

- Python: `3.11+`, package manager: `uv` or `poetry`
- Node: `>=20`, package manager: `pnpm`
- Go: `1.22+`

---

## Core Dependencies

Record major frameworks and libraries here (with versions).

- Backend framework: `<fill>`
- Frontend framework: `<fill>`
- Database: `<fill>`
- Cache/queue: `<fill>`
- Auth: `<fill>`
- Observability: `<fill>`

---

## Build, Test, Lint, Format

Keep these commands copy/paste-able and accurate.

- Install: `{{install_cmd}}`
- Test: `{{test_cmd}}`
- Lint: `{{lint_cmd}}`
- Format: `{{format_cmd}}`

If the repo uses `make`/`just`/`task` wrappers, list those instead.

---

## Dependency Freshness Policy

- Before adding/updating a dependency, verify the **latest stable** version and compatibility.
- Prefer latest stable compatible versions by default.
- If you must pin an older version, record the reason here and in the PR.

---

## Version Pinning Policy (Server/Infra)

- For server-side modules/tools, pin explicit versions (release tag or commit SHA).
- Avoid floating refs (`latest`, `main`, wildcard ranges) in production.
