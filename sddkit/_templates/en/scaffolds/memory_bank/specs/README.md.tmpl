# Memory Bank Specs (Optional)

This folder can host lightweight specs that are *not* part of the main SDD pipeline.

Examples:

- operational runbooks
- migration notes
- internal “work item” specs

If this repository uses Spec Kit, feature specs should live under the repo root:

- `specs/###-feature-name/`

If you prefer work-item specs inside the Memory Bank, use:

- `./work_items/`
