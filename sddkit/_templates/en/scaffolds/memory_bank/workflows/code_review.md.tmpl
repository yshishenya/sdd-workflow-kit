# Workflow: Code Review (PR Checklist)

Use this as a checklist for both PR authors and reviewers.

---

## PR author checklist

- [ ] PR is focused (no unrelated refactors/formatting churn).
- [ ] PR description is structured Markdown (headings + bullets/checklists), not a plain-text wall.
- [ ] Do not paste escaped control characters as visible text (`\\n`, `\\r\\n`, `\\t`); use real line breaks.
- [ ] Includes: context/goal, solution summary, verification steps, risks/rollback.
- [ ] Links: spec/work item, relevant issues/tickets.
- [ ] Tests updated when behaviour changes.
- [ ] Ran:
  - [ ] Format: `{{format_cmd}}`
  - [ ] Lint: `{{lint_cmd}}`
  - [ ] Test: `{{test_cmd}}`

## Reviewer checklist

- [ ] The change matches the spec/requirements.
- [ ] Naming and structure are clear; minimal complexity.
- [ ] No obvious security footguns (secrets, injection, authz bypass).
- [ ] Error handling is consistent and safe for callers.
- [ ] Tests cover critical paths and at least one negative case when applicable.
- [ ] Docs updated if user-facing behaviour changed.
