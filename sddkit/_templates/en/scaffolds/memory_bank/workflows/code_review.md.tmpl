# Code Review Process

## 1. General Check

### 1.1 Pull Request Quality

- [ ] Pull Request contains a clear description of changes
- [ ] PR base branch is `{{integration_branch}}` for regular work (no direct feature/bugfix/refactor/docs PRs to `main`)
- [ ] Description includes:
  - Context: what and why is being done
  - Technical solution: how it's implemented
  - Testing: how to verify
  - Screenshots/examples (if applicable)
- [ ] PR is linked to corresponding ticket/issue
- [ ] PR title follows Conventional Commits format
- [ ] PR size is reasonable (no more than 500 lines of changes, preferably <300)

### 1.2 Scope Check

- [ ] All modified files are related to the task being solved
- [ ] No unrelated changes (scope creep)
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No debug prints or console.log
- [ ] No dead code (unused imports, functions)

### 1.3 Commit History

- [ ] Commits have meaningful messages
- [ ] Follow Conventional Commits format
- [ ] Commit history is logical and clear
- [ ] No fixup commits for typos (should be squashed)

## 2. Coding Standards Compliance

### 2.1 Code Style

- [ ] Code complies with **[coding standards](../guides/coding_standards.md)**
- [ ] Variable, function, and class naming follows conventions:
  - `snake_case` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for classes
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- [ ] Formatting is consistent with Black
- [ ] Maximum line length: 100 characters

### 2.2 Type Hints

- [ ] All functions have type hints for parameters and return value
- [ ] Correct types from `typing` are used
- [ ] No use of `Any` (use concrete types or `object` as a last resort)
- [ ] Example:

  ```python
  # Good
  def fetch_data(url: str, timeout: int = 30) -> dict[str, object]:
      ...

  # Bad
  def fetch_data(url, timeout=30):  # No type hints
      ...
  ```

### 2.3 Docstrings

- [ ] All public functions and classes have docstrings
- [ ] Docstrings follow Google style
- [ ] Docstrings contain:
  - Brief description
  - Args with types and descriptions
  - Returns with description
  - Raises for exceptions
  - Example (if applicable)
- [ ] Example:

  ```python
  async def create_topup_payment(
      user_id: str,
      amount_kopeks: int,
      return_url: str,
  ) -> dict[str, str]:
      """Create a YooKassa payment for a wallet top-up.

      Args:
          user_id: Verified user id.
          amount_kopeks: Top-up amount in kopeks.
          return_url: Where to redirect after payment.

      Returns:
          Mapping with provider payment id and confirmation url.

      Raises:
          HTTPException: If validation fails or billing is disabled.
      """
      ...
  ```

## 3. Architecture and Patterns

### 3.1 Architectural Compliance

- [ ] Changes don't violate architectural principles from **[../patterns/](../patterns/)**
- [ ] New components follow established patterns
- [ ] Proper separation of responsibilities between modules:
  - `backend/open_webui/routers/` - FastAPI routers (API layer)
  - `backend/open_webui/models/` - DB models + persistence helpers
  - `backend/open_webui/utils/` - business logic and services
  - `src/` - SvelteKit frontend

### 3.2 Code Reuse

- [ ] No duplication of functionality existing in other parts of the project
- [ ] Existing Pydantic models are used
- [ ] Existing utility functions are used
- [ ] API clients from `integrations/` are reused

### 3.3 Dependency Management

- [ ] If new dependencies were added:
  - They are truly necessary
  - **[../tech_stack.md](../tech_stack.md)** is updated
  - Compatibility with current stack is verified
  - Necessity is justified (no lightweight alternatives)

## 4. Code Quality

### 4.1 Single Responsibility Principle

- [ ] Each function has one responsibility
- [ ] Each class has one responsibility
- [ ] Functions don't exceed 50 lines
- [ ] Files don't exceed 500 lines

### 4.2 Code Complexity

- [ ] No overly complex functions
- [ ] Nesting level doesn't exceed 3-4
- [ ] Complex conditions are extracted to separate functions with clear names
- [ ] Example:

  ```python
  # Good
  def is_eligible_for_discount(user: User) -> bool:
      return (
          user.is_premium
          and user.purchases_count > 10
          and user.account_age_days > 30
      )

  if is_eligible_for_discount(user):
      apply_discount()

  # Bad
  if user.is_premium and user.purchases_count > 10 and user.account_age_days > 30:
      apply_discount()
  ```

### 4.3 Error Handling

- [ ] Error handling follows **[../patterns/error_handling.md](../patterns/error_handling.md)**
- [ ] Specific exceptions are used (not bare `Exception`)
- [ ] No empty `except` blocks or `except: pass`
- [ ] All errors are logged with context
- [ ] User-facing errors don't contain internal details
- [ ] Example:

  ```python
  # Good
  try:
      result = await fetch_data(url)
  except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
      logger.warning("Upstream returned error", extra={"status_code": e.response.status_code})
      raise ExternalAPIError(f"API returned {e.response.status_code}")
  except httpx.TimeoutException:
      logger.warning("Upstream request timeout")
      raise ExternalAPIError("Request timeout")

  # Bad
  try:
      result = await fetch_data(url)
  except:  # Too broad!
      pass  # Silently ignoring!
  ```

### 4.4 Magic Numbers and Strings

- [ ] No "magic" numbers - named constants are used
- [ ] No hardcoded strings - constants or config are used
- [ ] Example:

  ```python
  # Good
  MAX_RETRIES = 3
  DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30

  @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(MAX_RETRIES))
  async def fetch_data(url: str, timeout: int = DEFAULT_TIMEOUT):
      pass

  # Bad
  @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3))  # What is 3?
  async def fetch_data(url: str, timeout: int = 30):  # What is 30?
      pass
  ```

## 5. Async Code Quality

### 5.1 Async Best Practices

- [ ] All I/O operations are asynchronous
- [ ] No blocking operations in async functions
- [ ] `httpx.AsyncClient` is used instead of `requests`
- [ ] `aiofiles` is used for file operations
- [ ] Example:

  ```python
  # Good
  async def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict[str, object]:
      async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
          response = await client.get(url)
          return response.json()

  # Bad - blocks event loop!
  async def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict[str, object]:
      response = requests.get(url)  # Blocking I/O!
      return response.json()
  ```

### 5.2 Resource Management

- [ ] Async context managers are used for resources
- [ ] Proper cleanup of resources (clients, connections, files)
- [ ] No resource leaks
- [ ] Example:

  ```python
  # Good - automatic cleanup
  async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
      response = await client.get(url)

  # Bad - risk of resource leak
  client = httpx.AsyncClient()
  response = await client.get(url)
  # What if exception? Client not closed!
  ```

### 5.3 Concurrency

- [ ] `asyncio.gather()` is used for parallel operations
- [ ] No race conditions
- [ ] Proper use of locks (if needed)
- [ ] Example:

  ```python
  # Good - parallel execution
  results = await asyncio.gather(
      fetch_data(url1),
      fetch_data(url2),
      fetch_data(url3)
  )

  # Bad - sequential execution
  result1 = await fetch_data(url1)
  result2 = await fetch_data(url2)
  result3 = await fetch_data(url3)
  ```

## 6. Testing

### 6.1 Test Coverage

- [ ] All new functions are covered by unit tests
- [ ] Code coverage >= 80% for new code
- [ ] Critical business logic has 100% coverage

### 6.2 Test Quality

- [ ] Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- [ ] Tests are independent of each other
- [ ] Tests have clear names (`test_function_name_expected_behavior`)
- [ ] Fixtures are used for setup/teardown
- [ ] Example:
  ```python
  @pytest.mark.asyncio
  async def test_fetch_data_handles_timeout():
      with pytest.raises(ExternalAPIError):
          await fetch_data("https://example.invalid", timeout=0.001)
  ```

### 6.3 Test Execution

- [ ] All tests pass (Docker Compose-first): see `../guides/testing_strategy.md`
- [ ] No warnings in tests
- [ ] Tests execute quickly (<5 minutes for entire suite)

### 6.4 Edge Cases

- [ ] Edge cases are tested
- [ ] Error handling is tested
- [ ] Input validation is tested
- [ ] For async code, timeouts are tested

## 7. Security

### 7.1 Secrets Management

- [ ] No hardcoded passwords, API keys, tokens
- [ ] All secrets in environment variables
- [ ] Configuration is via environment variables (see `.env.example`, `backend/open_webui/env.py` and persistent config where applicable)
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore`

### 7.2 Input Validation

- [ ] All user input is validated
- [ ] Pydantic models are used for validation
- [ ] No possibility of injection attacks

### 7.3 SQL Security

- [ ] Parameterized queries are used
- [ ] No string concatenations for SQL
- [ ] Example:

  ```python
  # Good: ORM only (SQLAlchemy)
  user = db.query(User).filter(User.email == email).first()

  # Bad: raw SQL strings / string interpolation
  # query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '{email}'"
  ```

### 7.4 Data Exposure

- [ ] Logs don't contain sensitive data (API keys, passwords, PII)
- [ ] Error messages don't show internal details to users
- [ ] User-facing messages don't contain stack traces

## 8. Performance

### 8.1 Efficiency

- [ ] No N+1 queries
- [ ] No excessive API calls
- [ ] Caching is used where appropriate
- [ ] Batch operations for bulk processing

### 8.2 Resource Usage

- [ ] Large data is processed in streaming fashion (not loaded entirely in memory)
- [ ] Generators are used for large collections
- [ ] Connection pooling for database

### 8.3 Async Optimization

- [ ] Parallel operations execute concurrently
- [ ] No excessive `await` statements (blocking parallelism)
