# Workflow: New Feature

Use this checklist when implementing a new feature in **{{project_name}}**.

If this repo uses Spec Kit, prefer the Spec Kit loop:

`spec.md -> plan.md -> tasks.md -> implement`

---

## 1) Define intent

- [ ] Capture the “why” and acceptance criteria (spec/work item).
- [ ] Identify non-goals and constraints.
- [ ] Identify risks and unknowns.

## 2) Plan

- [ ] Propose the smallest implementation that satisfies the spec.
- [ ] Define verification steps (real commands, expected outputs).
- [ ] Identify required migrations/config changes.

## 3) Implement

- [ ] Create a dedicated branch for this feature.
- [ ] Implement incrementally (small commits).
- [ ] Add/adjust tests for critical paths.

## 4) Validate

- [ ] Format: `{{format_cmd}}`
- [ ] Lint: `{{lint_cmd}}`
- [ ] Test: `{{test_cmd}}`

## 5) PR

- [ ] PR includes context, solution, verification steps, and rollback notes.
- [ ] Link the spec/work item.
