# Memory Bank (Seeded)

This directory is a lightweight, repo-local knowledge base for **{{project_name}}**.

It is designed to reduce repeated context loss for both humans and agents:

- One place to find the current state, constraints, and conventions
- A stable “table of contents” that can be referenced from `AGENTS.md`
- A conflict-minimizing workflow for tracking work across branches

**Ownership:** this Memory Bank is *seeded* by `sdd-kit` when enabled. After creation, it is **yours to edit**; the kit does not overwrite existing Memory Bank content.

---

## Mandatory Reading Sequence (Before Any Task)

1. `./tech_stack.md` (what we run, versions, critical dependencies)
2. `./guides/coding_standards.md` (formatting, naming, quality bar)
3. `./current_tasks.md` (what the team is doing right now, integration-branch only)

If this repo is a fork, also read:

- `./guides/upstream_sync.md`

## How to Use This Memory Bank

### Update rules

- If you add or update dependencies, update `./tech_stack.md`.
- If you introduce a new architectural pattern, add/update a doc under `./patterns/`.
- If you add a workflow that the team should follow repeatedly, add a doc under `./workflows/`.

### Conflict-free work tracking (important)

To avoid merge conflicts, treat `current_tasks.md` as integration-branch owned.

- On feature branches:
  - Do **not** edit `./current_tasks.md`
  - Write updates into `./branch_updates/*.md` (append-only, one file per branch)
- On the integration branch:
  - Consolidate `./branch_updates/*.md` into `./current_tasks.md`
  - Delete processed `./branch_updates/*.md` files

See the detailed rules:

- `./guides/task_updates.md`

## Recommended Structure (What Goes Where)

- `tech_stack.md`: versions, package managers, runtime requirements, build/test commands
- `product_brief.md`: goals, constraints, non-goals, user flows (optional)
- `patterns/`: architecture and design patterns (API standards, error handling, auth, etc.)
- `guides/`: how we work (coding standards, testing strategy, upstream sync, AI workflow)
- `workflows/`: checklists for common tasks (new feature, bug fix, refactor, code review)
- `specs/`: lightweight work-item specs (optional). If you use Spec Kit, feature specs live under `specs/###-feature/` at repo root instead.
