# Linking Rules

## Source links
- Always include a Sources section.
- Link each source session log used to build the post.
- Use a relative path from the output file to the log file.

## Internal file links
- Link to repository files that are explicitly referenced in the logs.
- If the file exists in the repo, link it with a relative path.
- If the file does not exist or the path is unclear, keep it as backticked text without a link.

## Related posts
- If there is a previous or next post for adjacent dates in the output directory, add links in a short Related section.
- Do not fabricate links. Only add them when the files exist.

## External links
- Only include external links when they appear in the session logs or the user requests them.
- Use Markdown links, not bare URLs.

## General
- Keep links minimal and relevant.
- Do not add line anchors unless the user explicitly asks.
- In MDX output, keep links compatible with the project's MDX conventions.
