# Style and Structure

## Language selection
- Default to the language used in the user's prompts inside the logs.
- If the prompts are mixed or unclear, ask the user to choose a primary language.

## Voice and tone
- Write in a clear, casual, technical-but-readable voice unless the user requests otherwise.
- Prefer first person plural (we) unless the user requests a different perspective.
- Avoid hype, sales language, or exaggerated claims.

## Tense
- Use past tense for completed work and present tense for current state or ongoing work.

## Structure
Use this default structure for a single-day post:
1. Title
2. Deck (1 to 2 sentence summary)
3. Highlights (3 to 7 bullets)
4. What we did (short paragraphs or bullets)
5. Decisions
6. Open questions
7. Next steps
8. Sources

For multi-day posts:
- Keep a shared title and deck.
- Use day subheads (YYYY-MM-DD) with Highlights and What we did under each.
- Keep Decisions, Open questions, and Next steps at the end.

## Formatting rules
- Use short paragraphs (2 to 4 sentences).
- Use bullets for lists of tasks, artifacts, and steps.
- Use backticks for file paths, commands, and identifiers.
- Keep headings in Title Case.

## MDX requirements
- Output must be `.mdx` and follow the project's MDX frontmatter and layout standards.
- If the standards are not found in the repo, ask the user before drafting.

## Content rules
- Ground every claim in the session logs.
- If a detail is missing, either omit it or mark it as UNCONFIRMED.
- Prefer concrete outcomes over process narration.
