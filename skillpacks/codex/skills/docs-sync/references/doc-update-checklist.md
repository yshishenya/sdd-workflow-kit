# Doc update checklist

- README: quickstart still works (install, dev, test, build).
- Setup: prerequisites and tool versions are current (Java/Node).
- Config: env vars + defaults documented; secrets clearly marked.
- API: endpoints or schema changes reflected (examples updated).
- DB: migrations/backfills documented; rollback notes included if needed.
- Ops: runbooks/alerts updated for behavior changes.
- Links: internal anchors and cross-links still valid.
